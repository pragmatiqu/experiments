## Experiments

This repository explores the intersection of [OpenUI5] and [Laravel], diving into how these powerful frameworks can work together to create dynamic, modern applications. Through focused experiments, we tackle specific challenges, such as integrating [SAP UI Integration Cards] into Laravel dashboards, with the goal of bridging enterprise-level tools with developer-friendly ecosystems.

**The Experimental Approach:**
- **Focused Questions:** Each experiment addresses a single, well-defined challenge to ensure clarity and depth.
- **Self-Contained:** Every exploration is isolated, making it easy to replicate, adapt, or expand.
- **Practical Outcomes:** The goal is not just theoretical understanding, but tangible, actionable results you can apply immediately.

**Why Experiments?**  
Adopting an experimental mindset fosters curiosity, encourages breaking down complex problems, and opens the door to discovering innovative solutions. Whether integrating SAP frameworks into Laravel, exploring containerized environments, or testing new development paradigms, each experiment is a step toward mastering cutting-edge technologies.

- [Experiment 1]–Dashboard w/SAP UI Integration Cards
- [Experiment 2]–Minimal Laravel Multi-Tenancy (external project)
- [Experiment 3]–Hybrid HTML Page w/OpenUi5 & Livewire
